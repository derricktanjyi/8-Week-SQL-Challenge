## Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!

### In this case study - I am required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

### Digital Analysis

#### Q1. How many users are there?
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT (DISTINCT user_id) AS total_users
FROM
  clique_bait.users;
```
| **total\_users** |
| ---------------- |
| 500              |

#### Q2. How many cookies does each user have on average?
```sql
WITH cte_cookies AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    COUNT(cookie_id) AS cookie_count
  FROM
    clique_bait.users
  GROUP BY
    user_id
)
SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(cookie_count), 2) AS avg_cookie_count
FROM
  cte_cookies;
```

| **avg\_cookie\_count** |
| ---------------------- |
| 3.56                   |

#### Q3. What is the unique number of visits by all users each month?
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('Month', event_time) AS month_start,
  COUNT (DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_visits
FROM
  clique_bait.events
GROUP BY
  month_start
ORDER BY
  month_start;
```

#### Q4. What is the number of events for each event type?
```sql

GROUP BY
  i.event_name,
  e.event_type

      END
    ) AS purchase_flag
  FROM
    clique_bait.events
  GROUP BY

    100 * SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN purchase_flag = 0 THEN 1

### Product Funnel Analysis

#### Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
* How many times was each product viewed?
* How many times was each product added to cart?
* How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
* How many times was each product purchased?

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_info;
CREATE TEMP TABLE product_info AS WITH cte_product_page_events AS ( --Creating The Table
  SELECT
    events.visit_id,
    page_hierarchy.product_id,
    page_hierarchy.page_name,
    page_hierarchy.product_category,
    SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1
        ELSE 0
      END
    ) AS page_view,
    SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1
        ELSE 0
      END
    ) AS cart_add
  FROM
    clique_bait.events
    INNER JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ON events.page_id = page_hierarchy.page_id
  WHERE
    page_hierarchy.product_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY
    events.visit_id,
    page_hierarchy.product_id,
    page_hierarchy.page_name,
    page_hierarchy.product_category
),
cte_visit_purchase AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT visit_id
  FROM
    clique_bait.events
  WHERE
    event_type = 3 -- purchase event
),
cte_combined_product_events AS (
  SELECT
    t1.visit_id,
    t1.product_id,
    t1.page_name,
    t1.product_category,
    t1.page_view,
    t1.cart_add,
    CASE
      WHEN t2.visit_id IS NULL THEN 0
      ELSE 1
    END as purchase
  FROM
    cte_product_page_events AS t1
    LEFT JOIN cte_visit_purchase AS t2 ON t1.visit_id = t2.visit_id
)
SELECT --Showing the Table
  product_id,
  page_name AS product,
  product_category,
  SUM(page_view) AS page_views,
  SUM(cart_add) AS cart_adds,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN cart_add = 1
      AND purchase = 0 THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS abandoned,
  SUM(
    CASE
      WHEN cart_add = 1
      AND purchase = 1 THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END
  ) AS purchases
FROM
  cte_combined_product_events
GROUP BY
  product_id,
  product_category,
  product;
SELECT
  *
FROM
  product_info
ORDER BY
  product_id;
```

#### Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS product_category_info;
CREATE TEMP TABLE product_category_info AS
SELECT
  product_category,
  SUM(page_views) AS page_views,
  SUM(cart_adds) AS cart_adds,
  SUM(abandoned) AS abandoned,
  SUM(purchases) AS purchases
FROM
  product_info
GROUP BY
  product_category;
SELECT
  *
FROM
  product_info
ORDER BY
  product_id;
SELECT
  *
FROM
  product_category_info
ORDER BY
  product_category;
```
| product\_category | page\_views | cart\_adds | abandoned | purchases |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| Fish              | 4633        | 2789       | 674       | 2115      |
| Luxury            | 3032        | 1870       | 466       | 1404      |
| Shellfish         | 6204        | 3792       | 894       | 2898      |

#### Q1. Which Product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?
```sql

|------------------------------|
|75.93                         |

### Campaigns Analysis

#### Generate a table that has 1 single row for every uniqueÂ visit_idÂ record and has the following columns:
* user_id
* visit_id
* visit_start_time: the earliestÂ event_timeÂ for each visit
* page_views: count of page views for each visit
* cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
* purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
* campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if theÂ visit_start_timeÂ falls between theÂ start_dateÂ andÂ end_date
* impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
* click: count of ad clicks for each visit
* cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart

```sql

  u.user_id,
